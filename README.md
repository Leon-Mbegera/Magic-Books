# REACT & REDUX BOOK STORE
Magic-books Inc. is a fictional company based in Germany. They have requested my help to build the front-end of an application that will help them organize and manage their bookstore. They want it to be fast, dynamic and responsive to their actions and therefore I have decided to build it with React & Redux.
